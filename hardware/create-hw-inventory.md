# create-hw-inventory.py

This script creates a yaml inventory file to be populated with data for a device.

The only filled field is the **id** field.

The data model is defined in [data-model.md](data-model.md).

To execute the script two arguments need to be used:

+ **--filename** to indicate the filename for the inventory file that will be created.
+ **--directory** directory where the inventory file will be created.
